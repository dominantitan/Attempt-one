# Session Wrap-Up Report
**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Session Focus:** First-Person Hunting System Implementation  
**Status:** 90% Complete - Core Working, Minor Bugs Remain

---

## üéØ Major Accomplishments

### ‚úÖ **Code Organization & Cleanup**
Resolved all conflicts between old and new systems:
- Renamed old `systems/hunting.lua` ‚Üí `systems/hunting.lua.OLD_BACKUP`
- Commented out 3 orphaned hunting functions in gameplay.lua (~180 lines)
- Removed hunting_area references (press H prompts, handlers)
- Clean separation: Only NEW first-person hunting system is active
- **Result:** No more system conflicts, cleaner codebase

### ‚úÖ **Complete Hunting System Overhaul**
Transformed from simple top-down system to full DOOM-style first-person hunting:

**Features Implemented:**
- First-person view with dark green forest background
- Mouse-controlled crosshair aiming system
- 3 weapons with distinct stats:
  - **Bow** (free starter): 500px range, 1.5s reload, 10¬∞ spread
  - **Rifle** ($200): 800px range, 2.0s reload, 5¬∞ spread
  - **Shotgun** ($350): 400px range, 2.5s reload, 20¬∞ spread
- Weapon pointing mechanic (gun follows cursor realistically)
- Projectile system with visual trails
- 180-second (3 minute) hunting sessions with countdown timer

**Animal System:**
- 4 animal types with spawn rates:
  - Rabbit (50%) - $15 meat, fast, low HP
  - Deer (30%) - $30 meat, medium, medium HP
  - Boar (15%) - $50 meat, slow, high HP
  - Tiger (5%) - $100 meat, INSTANT FEAR EJECTION
- Animals hide in bushes and "peek out" (30% chance visible)
- Sway animation when visible
- Hitbox detection with collision

**Economy Integration:**
- Limited ammo system (consumed on entry, unused returned on exit)
- Ammo shop prices: Arrows $15/10, Bullets $25/10, Shells $30/10
- Weapon purchases persist (one-time buy)
- Meat drops sold at shop for profit
- Hunting 3-4x more profitable than farming (as designed)

**Zone System:**
- 3 circular hunting zones on map:
  - **Northwestern Woods** (130, 130) - Easy zone
  - **Northeastern Grove** (830, 130) - Medium zone
  - **Southeastern Wilderness** (830, 410) - Hard zone (tigers!)
- Proximity prompts: "üéØ [Zone Name]: Press ENTER to hunt"
- Restricted hunting to zones only (no global access)

## üêõ Known Issues (To Fix Later)

### Critical Bugs
1. **Hunting Re-Entry Bug** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - **Issue:** Player still can't re-enter hunting after first session
   - **Root Cause:** Possibly ammo validation being too strict OR state not resetting properly
   - **Attempted Fix:** Moved `hunting.active = true` to after validation (line 197)
   - **Status:** Needs further testing and possibly checking gamestate manager

2. **Shop UI Overlap** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - **Issue:** With 11 items, shop list overflows window
   - **Fix Applied:** Added scrolling system (8 items visible, auto-scroll with UP/DOWN)
   - **Status:** Should be working, needs testing

### Minor Issues
3. **Visual Placeholders:**
   - Animals still rendered as colored rectangles (no sprites)
   - Bushes are simple green rectangles
   - Background is solid color (no texture/art)
   - No particle effects on shots/hits

4. **Audio Missing:**
   - No gunshot sounds
   - No animal sounds
   - No hit confirmation sounds
   - Background ambience missing

5. **UI Polish:**
   - No ammo counter during hunting
   - No kill counter during session (only on exit)
   - No hit markers/damage numbers

---

## üóëÔ∏è Files to Consider Removing

### Duplicate/Obsolete Systems
1. ‚úÖ **systems/hunting.lua.OLD_BACKUP** (89 lines) - ALREADY RENAMED
   - Old top-down hunting system
   - Already commented out in main.lua
   - Renamed to .OLD_BACKUP to prevent confusion
   - **Recommendation:** Can delete once confident NEW system works

2. **entities/animals.lua** (if not used elsewhere)
   - Top-down animal entities
   - Check if used by old hunting system only
   - **Recommendation:** Keep for now, may repurpose for world animals

### Unused Asset Folders (Check Before Deleting)
3. **assets/sprites/animals/** 
   - Check if empty or has unused files
   - **Recommendation:** Keep for future sprite implementation

4. **assets/sprites/environment/**
   - Check for unused files
   - **Recommendation:** Keep for future background art

### Documentation Files (Consider Consolidating)
5. Multiple .md files in root:
   - HUNTING_SYSTEM_TEST.md
   - HUNTING_FIX_COMPLETE.md
   - HUNTING_GUIDE.md
   - HUNTING_ZONES_GUIDE.md
   - HUNTING_ECONOMY.md
   - **Recommendation:** Merge into single HUNTING.md comprehensive guide

6. **REFACTOR_LOG.md** - May be outdated
7. **GAME_ASSESSMENT.md** - May need updating
8. **MVP_STATUS.md** - Redundant with CURRENT_STATE.md?

## üîß Technical Debt

### Architecture Issues
1. **Two Hunting Systems Coexist:**
   - `systems/hunting.lua` (old, disabled)
   - `states/hunting.lua` (new, active)
   - **Action Needed:** Remove old system after confirming new one works

2. **Duplicate Entry Logic:**
   - gameplay.lua has TWO ENTER handlers (lines 165-171 and 220-230)
   - Both call `gamestate.switch("hunting")`
   - **Action Needed:** Consolidate or document why both exist

3. **State Management Unclear:**
   - `hunting.active` flag purpose unclear
   - May be redundant with gamestate manager
   - **Action Needed:** Review if needed or can be removed

### Code Quality
1. **Magic Numbers:**
   - Hardcoded positions (gunX=480, gunY=450)
   - Hardcoded colors (0.2, 0.4, 0.2 for green)
   - **Action Needed:** Extract to constants at top of file

2. **No Error Handling:**
   - `require()` calls not wrapped in pcall
   - No nil checks on playerEntity
   - **Action Needed:** Add defensive programming

3. **Performance Concerns:**
   - Spawning animals every frame (0.5% chance)
   - No animal pooling/recycling
   - **Action Needed:** Optimize spawn logic

## üìä Current Game Balance

### Economy Working As Designed:
‚úÖ **Farming:** Seeds $10-20 ‚Üí Crops sell $4-10 = Barely profitable (slow grind)  
‚úÖ **Hunting:** Ammo $15-30 ‚Üí Meat sells $15-100 = 3-4x more profitable (risky)  
‚úÖ **Foraging:** Free collection ‚Üí Sells $5-8 = Safe backup income  

### Weapon Progression:
‚úÖ **Early:** Bow (free) with arrows ($15/10) = Accessible to all players  
‚úÖ **Mid:** Rifle ($200) with bullets ($25/10) = First major purchase goal  
‚úÖ **Late:** Shotgun ($350) with shells ($30/10) = Endgame weapon for pros  

### Risk vs Reward:
‚úÖ **Rabbit:** Low risk, low reward ($15) - Practice target  
‚úÖ **Deer:** Medium risk, medium reward ($30) - Main income  
‚úÖ **Boar:** High risk, high reward ($50) - Skilled hunters  
‚úÖ **Tiger:** EXTREME risk, huge reward ($100) - Fear mechanic prevents abuse

## üí≠ Design Philosophy Summary

This session maintained the core design vision:

1. **Hunting as Primary Income** - More profitable than farming, encourages risk-taking
2. **Limited Resources** - Ammo scarcity creates tension and strategy
3. **Weapon Progression** - Clear upgrade path gives long-term goals
4. **Zone-Based Access** - Prevents random hunting everywhere, creates exploration
5. **Session-Based Design** - 3-minute timer creates focused gameplay loops
6. **Economy Balance** - Farming = backup, Hunting = main income, Foraging = filler

All systems working toward MVP goal of **"farm, hunt, profit"** gameplay loop.

## üìù Notes for Future Development

### What Went Well:
- First-person hunting implementation exceeded expectations
- Economy integration seamless with existing shop
- Zone system provides good exploration incentive
- Tiger fear mechanic adds exciting risk element

### What Needs Work:
- State management between hunting/gameplay needs review
- Re-entry bug suggests gamestate manager may have issues
- Too many documentation files cluttering workspace
- Placeholder visuals reducing game feel

### Lessons Learned:
- Having two systems with same name causes confusion
- Early validation prevents bugs (should validate BEFORE setting state)
- Scrolling UI simple to implement, should have done from start
- Documentation good but needs consolidation
