# 🎮 Quick Summary - October 15, 2025 Session

## What We Built Today ✅
1. **Complete First-Person Hunting System** (DOOM-style)
   - Mouse aiming with crosshair
   - 3 weapons (bow, rifle, shotgun)
   - 4 animals (rabbit, deer, boar, tiger with fear mechanic)
   - 3 hunting zones on map
   - 180-second timed sessions
   - Full economy integration (buy ammo/weapons, sell meat)

2. **Shop Scrolling System**
   - Shows 8 items at a time
   - Auto-scrolls with UP/DOWN navigation
   - Scroll indicators (▲▼)

3. **Code Organization & Cleanup**
   - Resolved ALL conflicts between old/new hunting systems
   - Renamed old `systems/hunting.lua` → `systems/hunting.lua.OLD_BACKUP`
   - Commented out 3 orphaned hunting functions (~180 lines)
   - Removed hunting_area references from gameplay
   - **Result:** Clean codebase, no system conflicts

## Known Bugs 🐛
1. **CRITICAL:** Player can't re-enter hunting after first session
   - Attempted fix: Moved `hunting.active = true` to after validation
   - Needs more debugging

2. **Shop UI overlapping** (fix applied, needs testing)

## Files Changed 📁
- `states/hunting.lua` - Complete rewrite (801 lines)
- `states/shop.lua` - Added scrolling (258 lines)
- `states/gameplay.lua` - Fixed zone entry, cleaned up old code (533 lines)
- `systems/hunting.lua` → `systems/hunting.lua.OLD_BACKUP` (renamed)

## Files Created 📝
- `SESSION_WRAPUP.md` - Full session details
- `CLEANUP_GUIDE.md` - Files to remove/consolidate
- `CODE_ORGANIZATION_REPORT.md` - System conflict resolution
- `QUICK_SUMMARY.md` - This quick summary

## Next Session TODO 📋
1. Debug hunting re-entry bug (PRIORITY)
2. Test shop scrolling
3. ~~Remove old hunting system~~ ✅ DONE (renamed to .OLD_BACKUP)
4. Consolidate documentation files
5. Add visual polish (sprites, sounds, HUD)

## How to Test 🧪
```powershell
cd "c:\dev\Attempt one" ; love .
# Walk to Northwestern Woods (130, 130)
# Press ENTER to hunt
# Exit and try to re-enter (BUG: won't work)
```

## Game is 90% Working! 🎉
Core hunting system complete, just needs bug fixes and polish.
