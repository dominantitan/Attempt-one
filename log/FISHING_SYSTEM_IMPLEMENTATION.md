## üéØ Spear Mechanics

### Fishing Spear (Default - Inherited)
```lua
{
    name = "Fishing Spear",
    damage = 100,           -- One-hit kill
    throwSpeed = 400,       -- Pixels per second
    retrieveTime = 2.0,     -- 2 seconds to retrieve
    range = 200,            -- Max distance
    areaOfEffect = 0        -- Single target only
}
```

### Fishing Net (Upgrade - $50)
```lua
{
    name = "Fishing Net",
    damage = 100,
    throwSpeed = 300,       -- Slower throw
    retrieveTime = 3.0,     -- Takes longer to retrieve
    range = 150,            -- Shorter range
    areaOfEffect = 50       -- Can catch MULTIPLE fish!
}
```

**Net Advantage:** Can catch 2-3 fish in one throw if they're grouped together!

## üêç Snake Danger System

### Spawn Mechanics
- **Spawn Timer:** Random 30-60 seconds
- **Warning Phase:** 3 seconds with pulsing red visual + "‚ö†Ô∏è SNAKE!" text
- **Attack Phase:** Chases player at 150 speed
- **Instant Death:** Snake bite = game over ‚Üí death state

### Defense Options
1. **Kill it:** Hit with spear ‚Üí drops snake skin ($15)
2. **Exit:** Leave fishing area (ESC)
3. **Dodge:** Move away (snake follows slowly during warning)

### Snake Stats
```lua
{
    name = "Water Snake",
    size = 50,
    speed = 150,
    damage = 100,           -- INSTANT DEATH
    health = 50,            -- Can be killed
    warningTime = 3.0,      -- 3 second warning
    value = 15              -- Snake skin sell price
}
```

## üåä Pond Environment

### Depth Zones
- **Shallow (0-150px):** Light blue, small fish spawn here
- **Medium (150-450px):** Blue, all fish types
- **Deep (450-600px):** Dark blue, catfish prefer this area

### Decorations
- **Lily Pads:** 10 random surface decorations
- **Reeds:** 15 along left/right edges
- **Rocks:** 8 on pond bottom

### Visual Effects
- **Player legs** visible in water (two feet + ripples)
- **Fish shadows** with different shapes per species
- **Splash particles** on spear throw
- **Catch sparkles** when fish caught
- **Blood particles** when snake killed
- **Pulsing red** during snake warning

## üéÆ Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **MOUSE** | Aim spear direction (crosshair) |
| **LEFT CLICK** | Throw spear |
| **SPACE** | Retrieve spear early (if missed) |
| **ESC** | Exit fishing, return to overworld |

**Entry:** Press **ENTER** at pond structure in overworld

---

## üí∞ Economy Integration

### Shop Integration (states/shop.lua)
**Added Items:**
- **Fishing Net:** $50 (one-time purchase, enables multi-catch)

**Sell Prices:**
- Small Fish: $5
- Bass: $12
- Catfish: $20
- Rare Trout: $35
- Snake Skin: $15

### Income Comparison
- **Farming:** $4-10 per crop (slow, needs seeds + water + time)
- **Fishing:** $5-35 per fish (skill-based, safer than hunting)
- **Hunting:** $15-100 per kill (dangerous, high reward)
- **Foraging:** $5-8 per item (free, random spawns)

**Fishing Strategy:**
- Early game: Safe consistent income with spear
- Mid game: Buy net ($50), multi-catch for efficiency
- Late game: Quick cash between hunting runs
