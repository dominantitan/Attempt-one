# Fishing System Refactor - Implementation Guide
**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress - Needs Manual File Creation

---

## üéØ Goal

Refactor fishing from a mini-game overlay to an area system like hunting:
- Top-down view (not first-person)
- Mouse-aimed spear throwing
- Snake danger with instant death (like tiger)
- Fewer fish (5-8 instead of 15)
- Harder difficulty

---

## üìù Required Changes

### 1. states/fishing.lua - CREATE NEW FILE

Create a simple 300-line fishing.lua based on hunting.lua structure. Key features:

```lua
-- Minimal structure:
local fishing = {}
fishing.active = false
fishing.fish = {} -- 5-8 fish
fishing.snake = nil -- Spawns after 30-60s
fishing.projectiles = {} -- Spear throws

function fishing:enter(fromState, areaId)
    -- Spawn fish, reset snake timer, show mouse
end

function fishing:update(dt)
    -- Update fish movement
    -- Update spear projectiles  
    -- Update snake (3s warning, then chase)
    -- Check snake collision = death
end

function fishing:draw()
    -- Simple blue water
    -- Fish shadows (circles)
    -- Snake (red circle if warning, else dark red)
    -- Spear projectiles
    -- Player legs
    -- Crosshair
    -- UI
end

function fishing:mousepressed(x, y, button)
    -- Throw spear toward mouse
end

function fishing:keypressed(key)
    -- ESC to exit
end
```

### 2. systems/areas.lua - ALREADY DONE ‚úÖ

Added fishing zone and area definition:
- Fishing zone at pond (630, 480, radius 60)
- fishing_pond area (800x600)
- Fish count: 5-8 (reduced from 15)
- Added `getPlayerNearFishingZone()` function

### 3. states/gameplay.lua - NEEDS UPDATE

Add fishing zone check in keypressed(), right after hunting zone check (around line 270):

```lua
-- Check for fishing zones
local nearFishingZone = areas.getPlayerNearFishingZone(playerSystem.x, playerSystem.y)
if nearFishingZone then
    print("üé£ Entering " .. nearFishingZone.name .. " - Top-Down Fishing!")
    local zoneId = nearFishingZone.target or nearFishingZone.name
    gamestate.switch("fishing", zoneId)
    return
end
```

Also update the prompt display (around line 92):

```lua
-- Add after hunting zone check:
local nearFishingZone = areas.getPlayerNearFishingZone(playerSystem.x, playerSystem.y)
if nearFishingZone then
    prompt = "üé£ " .. nearFishingZone.name .. ": Press ENTER to fish"
end
```

Remove old pond interaction code (key == "return" for fishing structure).

### 4. states/death.lua - ALREADY DONE ‚úÖ

Added snake death message:
- Accepts death cause parameter
- Shows snake emoji and message if cause == "snake"

### 5. states/shop.lua - ALREADY DONE ‚úÖ

- Fishing Net: $50
- Fish sell prices added

## üêç Snake Behavior (Like Tiger)

```lua
-- Spawn after 30-60 seconds
fishing.snakeSpawnTimer = math.random(30, 60)

-- 3 second warning with pulsing red visual
fishing.snakeWarning = true
fishing.snakeWarningTimer = 3.0

-- After warning, chase player at 150 speed
-- If reaches player (distance < 40): INSTANT DEATH
gamestate.switch("death", "snake")
```

---

## üêü Fish System (Simplified)

```lua
-- Only 5-8 fish spawn (harder)
local fishCount = math.random(5, 8)

-- 4 types with different speeds:
small_fish: speed 100, value $5
bass: speed 80, value $12
catfish: speed 60, value $20
rare_trout: speed 120, value $35

-- Simple AI: random movement, bounce off boundaries
if math.random() < 0.02 then
    fish.vx = (math.random() - 0.5) * fish.type.speed
    fish.vy = (math.random() - 0.5) * fish.type.speed
end
```

---

## üéØ Spear Mechanics

```lua
-- Mouse aim, click to throw
function fishing:throwSpear()
    local dx = mouseX - playerX
    local dy = mouseY - playerY
    -- Normalize and create projectile
    -- Speed: 400 pixels/second
    -- Lifetime: 1 second
    -- AOE: 10 (spear) or 50 (net)
end

-- Collision: distance < aoe + fish.size
-- On hit: add to inventory, remove fish
```

---

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

1. ‚úÖ areas.lua updated with fishing zone
2. ‚úÖ death.lua updated with snake death
3. ‚úÖ shop.lua updated with net and fish prices
4. ‚úÖ Removed old goFishing() function
5. ‚úÖ Updated pond prompt text

---

## ‚ùå What Needs Manual Creation

**states/fishing.lua** - File got corrupted during automated creation. Needs to be created manually with the structure above.

---

## üéÆ Final Flow

```
Player ‚Üí Pond (630, 480)
‚Üí Prompt: "üé£ Pond: Press ENTER to fish"
‚Üí Press ENTER
‚Üí gamestate.switch("fishing", "fishing_pond")
‚Üí fishing:enter() spawns 5-8 fish
‚Üí Top-down view, mouse aim, click to throw spear
‚Üí Snake spawns after 30-60s
‚Üí 3s warning, then chases
‚Üí If caught: gamestate.switch("death", "snake")
‚Üí Press ESC: return to gameplay
```

---

## üîß Debugging Tips

1. Test pond zone detection: walk to (630, 480)
2. Check prompt appears: "Press ENTER to fish"
3. Press ENTER: should switch to fishing state
4. If crash: fishing.lua has errors
5. Check snake spawn timer in console
6. Test snake death by letting it catch you
7. Test fish catching with left click

**STATUS:** Need to manually create fishing.lua file due to file corruption issues with automated tool.
