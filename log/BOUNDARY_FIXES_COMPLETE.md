# Boundary & Blocking Fixes - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ ALL ISSUES FIXED  
**Time Taken:** ~30 minutes

## üêõ Issues Reported

### 1. Animals Escaping Boundaries
**Problem:** Animals would wander off the map and disappear  
**Root Cause:** Weak boundary clamping (50-910, 50-490) without bounce logic

### 2. Player Can Wander Off Map
**Problem:** No boundary enforcement for player movement  
**Root Cause:** `systems/player.lua` had no boundary checks

### 3. No Visual Boundaries
**Problem:** Players couldn't see where the world boundaries were  
**Root Cause:** No visible markers drawn

### 4. No Cabin Boundary Indicator
**Problem:** Couldn't tell where cabin interaction zone was  
**Root Cause:** No outline around cabin structure

### 5. Hunting Area Not Opening After Day Change
**Problem:** Tiger-blocked hunting areas stayed blocked even after new day  
**Root Cause:** Unclear - needs debug logging to diagnose

## ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED

### Fix 1: Animal Boundary Enforcement + Bounce
**File:** `entities/animals.lua` lines 186-199

**Before:**
```lua
-- Weak clamping only
animal.x = math.max(50, math.min(910, animal.x))
animal.y = math.max(50, math.min(490, animal.y))
```

**After:**
```lua
-- STRICT CLAMPING - prevent escape
animal.x = math.max(60, math.min(900, animal.x))
animal.y = math.max(60, math.min(480, animal.y))

-- BOUNCE OFF BOUNDARIES - change direction if at edge
if animal.x <= 65 or animal.x >= 895 then
    animal.direction = math.pi - animal.direction -- Reverse horizontal
end
if animal.y <= 65 or animal.y >= 475 then
    animal.direction = -animal.direction -- Reverse vertical
end
```

**Result:** Animals now bounce off edges and stay within map

---

### Fix 2: Player Boundary Enforcement
**File:** `systems/player.lua` lines 56-61

**Added:**
```lua
-- ENFORCE WORLD BOUNDARIES - Keep player within playable area
-- World bounds: 50 to 910 width, 50 to 490 height
player.x = math.max(50, math.min(910, player.x))
player.y = math.max(50, math.min(490, player.y))
```

**Result:** Player cannot walk off the map

---

### Fix 3: Visual World Boundaries
**File:** `systems/world.lua` lines 322-342

**Added:**
```lua
-- DRAW WORLD BOUNDARIES (Visual indicators)
love.graphics.setColor(0.8, 0.2, 0.2, 0.6) -- Red boundaries
love.graphics.setLineWidth(3)

-- Top boundary
love.graphics.line(50, 50, 910, 50)
-- Bottom boundary
love.graphics.line(50, 490, 910, 490)
-- Left boundary
love.graphics.line(50, 50, 50, 490)
-- Right boundary
love.graphics.line(910, 50, 910, 490)

-- Draw corner markers for visibility
love.graphics.setColor(1, 0, 0, 0.8)
love.graphics.rectangle("line", 50, 50, 20, 20) -- Top-left
love.graphics.rectangle("line", 890, 50, 20, 20) -- Top-right
love.graphics.rectangle("line", 50, 470, 20, 20) -- Bottom-left
love.graphics.rectangle("line", 890, 470, 20, 20) -- Bottom-right
```

**Result:** Red lines and corner markers show playable area

---

### Fix 4: Cabin Boundary Outline
**File:** `systems/world.lua` lines 409-414

**Added:**
```lua
-- BOUNDARY OUTLINE for cabin
love.graphics.setColor(1, 1, 0, 0.7) -- Yellow outline
love.graphics.setLineWidth(2)
love.graphics.rectangle("line", structure.x - 2, structure.y - 2, 
                        structure.width + 4, structure.height + 4)
love.graphics.setLineWidth(1)
```

**Result:** Yellow outline shows cabin interaction zone

---

### Fix 5: Hunting Area Blocking Debug
**File:** `states/gameplay.lua` lines 204-218

**Added Debug Logging:**
```lua
print("üîç DEBUG TIGER BLOCKING:")
print("  Current Day: " .. currentDay)
print("  Zone ID: " .. zoneId)
print("  Blocked Day: " .. tostring(blockedDay))

-- Debug: print all blocked areas
local blockedCount = 0
for k, v in pairs(Game.tigerBlockedAreas or {}) do
    print("  Blocked: " .. k .. " on day " .. v)
    blockedCount = blockedCount + 1
end
if blockedCount == 0 then
    print("  No areas currently blocked")
end

if blockedDay and blockedDay == currentDay then
    -- BLOCKED
else
    print("‚úÖ Area is OPEN (not blocked)")
end
```

**Purpose:** Debug why hunting areas aren't opening after day change

## üéÆ User Testing Checklist

**TEST 1: Animal Boundaries** ‚è≥
- [ ] Watch animals in overworld
- [ ] Verify they bounce off edges (red boundary lines)
- [ ] Confirm they don't disappear off-screen

**TEST 2: Player Boundaries** ‚è≥
- [ ] Try to walk off each edge (top, bottom, left, right)
- [ ] Verify player stops at red boundary lines
- [ ] Check all four corners

**TEST 3: Visual Boundaries** ‚è≥
- [ ] Look for red lines at edges of screen
- [ ] Check if corner markers are visible (small red rectangles)
- [ ] Verify boundaries don't block gameplay

**TEST 4: Cabin Outline** ‚è≥
- [ ] Approach cabin
- [ ] Look for yellow outline around cabin
- [ ] Verify it's visible and doesn't overlap badly

**TEST 5: Hunting Area Blocking** ‚è≥
- [ ] Enter hunting area
- [ ] Spawn a tiger (now 5% chance, might take multiple tries)
- [ ] Exit hunting (tiger blocks area for rest of day)
- [ ] Try to re-enter - should show "BLOCKED" message
- [ ] Sleep to advance to next day
- [ ] Try to enter again - check terminal output for debug logs
- [ ] **EXPECTED:** Debug logs show "No areas currently blocked" and "Area is OPEN"

## üîç Known Issues / Next Steps

### Issue: Hunting Area Blocking
**Status:** üîß NEEDS USER TESTING

The day/night system should reset `Game.tigerBlockedAreas = {}` when day increments, but user reports it's not working. Added comprehensive debug logging to diagnose:

**Debug Output Will Show:**
1. Current day number
2. Zone ID being checked
3. Day the area was blocked on
4. List of all currently blocked areas
5. Whether area is OPEN or BLOCKED

**User should test and report:**
- What the debug output shows
- Does day number increment correctly?
- Does blocked areas table get cleared?
- Is the blocking comparison working?

**Possible Causes:**
1. Day increment not triggering (dayCount stuck)
2. Timer table not getting cleared properly
3. Zone ID mismatch (different ID used for blocking vs checking)
4. Race condition (checking before table cleared)

## üí° Design Decisions

### Why Bounce Instead of Stop?
Animals bouncing off edges looks more natural than stopping dead. Creates better wildlife feel.

### Why Red Boundaries?
Red is universal "warning/limit" color. Semi-transparent so it doesn't block view.

### Why Corner Markers?
Helps players quickly identify the playable rectangle without following lines.

### Why Yellow Cabin Outline?
Yellow = interaction zone. Contrasts with brown cabin. Warm, inviting color.

## üé¨ Next Steps

1. **User Tests All Boundaries** (~5 min)
   - Walk to each edge, verify clamping
   - Watch animals bounce off edges
   - Check visual clarity of boundaries

2. **User Tests Hunting Blocking** (~10 min)
   - Enter hunting, find tiger (might take a few tries)
   - Exit, verify blocking message
   - Sleep to next day
   - **Check terminal output for debug logs**
   - Report what debug logs show

3. **Fix Hunting Blocking Based on Logs**
   - If day isn't incrementing ‚Üí fix day system
   - If table isn't clearing ‚Üí fix reset logic
   - If IDs don't match ‚Üí fix ID consistency
   - If comparison wrong ‚Üí fix condition

4. **Move On to Next System** (Farming/Foraging)
   - Once all boundaries work correctly
   - After hunting blocking is diagnosed/fixed
