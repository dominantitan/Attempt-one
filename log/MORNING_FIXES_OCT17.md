# ðŸ”§ CRITICAL FIXES - Session Oct 17, 2025 (Morning)

## âœ… COMPLETED (30 minutes)

### 1. Tiger Chase Death Check âœ…
**File:** `systems/world.lua` (line ~451)  
**Fix:** Added health check to stop tiger chase if tiger dies
```lua
if tiger.health and tiger.health <= 0 then
    Game.tigerChasing = false
    world.tigerChase = nil
    return
end
```
**Impact:** Tiger chase now properly ends if tiger is killed
**Testing:** Need to test in-game by killing tiger while being chased

---

### 2. Spawn Cooldown System âœ…
**File:** `states/hunting.lua`  
**Changes:**
- Line 29: Added `hunting.spawnCooldown = 0` variable
- Line 333: Update cooldown in main loop
- Lines 345-356: Added cooldown logic to spawn system
  - 2 second cooldown on successful spawn
  - 5 second cooldown if spawn fails

**Before:**
```lua
if #hunting.animals < 3 and math.random() < 0.005 then
    hunting:spawnAnimal() -- Could spam every frame
end
```

**After:**
```lua
if #hunting.animals < 3 and hunting.spawnCooldown <= 0 then
    if math.random() < 0.005 then
        local spawned = hunting:spawnAnimal()
        hunting.spawnCooldown = spawned and 2 or 5
    end
end
```

**Impact:** Prevents performance issues from repeated spawn attempts
**Testing:** Monitor FPS during extended hunting sessions

---

### 3. Projectile Cleanup Enhanced âœ…
**File:** `states/hunting.lua`  
**Changes:**
- Lines 564-566: Added `startX`, `startY`, `maxDistance` to projectiles
- Lines 319-330: Enhanced removal logic with distance tracking

**Removal Conditions (any triggers removal):**
- âœ… Lifetime expired (2 seconds)
- âœ… Off-screen (x < 0 or x > 960 or y < 0 or y > 540)
- âœ… Max distance traveled (>2000 pixels)
- âœ… Hit an animal

**Impact:** Prevents memory leak from projectiles flying forever
**Testing:** Shoot 100 arrows, verify they're all cleaned up

---

## ðŸ§ª NEXT: TEST THE GAME

### Test Plan:
1. **Launch game** - `love .`
2. **Test ammo system:**
   - Check starting arrows (should be 10)
   - Enter hunting
   - Shoot 3 times
   - Exit hunting
   - Re-enter - verify 7 arrows remain âœ…

3. **Test spawn cooldown:**
   - Stay in hunting for 5+ minutes
   - Monitor animal spawns
   - Check FPS stays stable

4. **Test projectile cleanup:**
   - Shoot many arrows off-screen
   - Verify no memory issues

5. **Test tiger chase death:**
   - Provoke tiger
   - Get chased
   - (Need way to damage tiger in overworld - may need separate test)
