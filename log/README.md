## Documentation Workflow (Going Forward)

### ❌ OLD Workflow
1. Create new `.md` file for each topic
2. Files scattered in root directory
3. Hard to maintain consistency
4. Difficult to search across all docs

### ✅ NEW Workflow
1. **All new documentation goes into `FULL_DOCUMENTATION.md`**
2. Add new sections with proper headers
3. Use markdown formatting for consistency
4. Single file for easy searching (Ctrl+F)
5. Individual files archived here for reference

## How to Use

### Finding Information
1. **Start with**: `../FULL_DOCUMENTATION.md` (search with Ctrl+F)
2. **If needed**: Check specific files here for detailed context
3. **For setup**: See `../README.md`
