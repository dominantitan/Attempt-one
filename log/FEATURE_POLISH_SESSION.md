## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Forage Item Glow Effect
**File:** `systems/foraging.lua`

**Implementation:**
- Added pulsing glow animation using `love.timer.getTime()` with sine wave
- Three-layer rendering: outer glow ‚Üí middle glow ‚Üí solid center
- Bright white highlight ring that pulses
- Fades smoothly using sine waves (speed 2-3)

**Visual Effects:**
```lua
pulse = 0.3 + (math.sin(time * 3) * 0.15) -- 0.15-0.45 range
glowPulse = 0.6 + (math.sin(time * 2) * 0.3) -- 0.3-0.9 range
```

**Color Coding:**
- ü´ê Wild Berries: Purple (0.4, 0.1, 0.8)
- üçÑ Mushrooms: Brown (0.6, 0.4, 0.2)
- üåø Wild Herbs: Green (0.2, 0.8, 0.3)
- üå∞ Pine Nuts: Brown (0.5, 0.3, 0.1)

**Result:** Wild crops now stand out beautifully and are easy to spot while foraging!

### 2. Farming Growth Stages
**File:** `systems/farming.lua`

**Implementation:**
- Added 4 distinct visual stages based on growth progress
- Stage calculation: `math.floor(progress * 4)`
- Each stage has unique appearance

**Stages:**
```lua
Stage 0 (0-25%): SEED
- Small brown dot (radius 3px)
- Barely visible

Stage 1 (25-50%): SPROUT  
- Small green circle (radius 5px)
- Tiny stem (2x4 rectangle)
- Light green color

Stage 2 (50-75%): GROWING
- Larger plant (radius 8px)
- Two side leaves (radius 4px each)
- Medium green color

Stage 3 (75-100%): HARVESTABLE
- Full plant with outer glow
- Red fruit/produce indicators (3 circles)
- Bright green, ready to harvest
```

**Result:** Clear visual progression makes farming more engaging and informative!

### 3. Watering System with Sparkles
**Files:** `systems/farming.lua`, `states/gameplay.lua`

**Implementation:**
- Added W key as alternative to Q for watering
- Tracks `wateredRecently` flag and `wateredTime` timer
- Animated blue sparkles appear for 2 seconds after watering
- Sparkles fade out gradually

**Sparkle Animation:**
```lua
- 4 sparkles orbit around crop center
- Rotate using sine/cosine (speed 3)
- Distance pulses (8px ¬± 3px)
- Alpha fades from 0.8 to 0 over 2 seconds
- Blue color (0.3, 0.7, 1.0)
```

**Visual Feedback:**
- Blue water bar when fully watered
- Orange bar when needs water
- Animated sparkles during watering
- Clear progress indicator

**Result:** Satisfying visual feedback makes watering feel rewarding!

### 4. Crop Harvest Rewards
**File:** `systems/farming.lua`

**Implementation:**
- Different yield amounts per crop type
- Items automatically added to player inventory
- Value calculation and console feedback

**Yield Amounts:**
```lua
Carrot:   2-4 items (worth $4 each = $8-16)
Potato:   3-5 items (worth $7 each = $21-35)  
Mushroom: 2-3 items (worth $10 each = $20-30)
```

**Harvest Flow:**
1. Check if crop is ready (stage 3)
2. Calculate random yield based on crop type
3. Add items to player inventory
4. Clear plot for next planting
5. Print harvest success message

**Result:** Farming now gives tangible rewards with variety per crop type!

## üîß In Progress

### 5. Shop Stock Limits & Daily Refresh
**Target File:** `states/shop.lua`
**Status:** Next to implement

**Plan:**
- Add stock tracking to each shop item
- Initial stock: Seeds (10), Arrows (30), Bullets (20), Shells (15)
- Display "OUT OF STOCK" when depleted
- Refresh stock at midnight via daynight.lua
- Prevents infinite ammo exploit

**Benefits:**
- Forces player to hunt in different areas
- Makes ammo management strategic
- Adds daily rhythm to gameplay
- Prevents cheese strategies

## üìã Not Started

### 6. Special Shop Items
**Target File:** `states/shop.lua`
**Status:** Waiting for #5 to complete

**Items to Add:**
```lua
{
    name = "Healing Potion",
    price = 25,
    effect = "restores 50 HP",
    description = "Emergency healing for dangerous situations"
},
{
    name = "Watering Can",
    price = 30,
    effect = "holds 10 water charges",
    description = "Efficient farming tool (refill at pond)"
},
{
    name = "Backpack Upgrade",
    price = 100,
    effect = "+10 inventory slots",
    description = "Carry more items (one-time purchase)"
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Healing Potion: Consumable, use from inventory
- Watering Can: Equipment, refillable tool
- Backpack: Permanent upgrade to player.inventory.maxSlots
