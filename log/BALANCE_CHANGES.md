## 📊 Farming Changes (NERFED)

### Crop Growth Times (MUCH SLOWER)
| Crop | Before | After | Change |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| Carrot | 30s | **60s** | 2x slower ⏳ |
| Potato | 45s | **90s** | 2x slower ⏳ |

### Growth Speed Without Water (HARSH PENALTY)
- **Before:** 30% speed without full water
- **After:** **10% speed** without full water
- **Impact:** Crops take 10x longer if not properly watered!

### Harvest Yields (LOWER REWARDS)

## 💰 Economy Changes

### Seed Prices (MORE EXPENSIVE)
| Item | Before | After | Change |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| Carrot Seeds | $5 | **$10** | 2x cost 💸 |
| Potato Seeds | $8 | **$15** | ~2x cost 💸 |
| Mushroom Spores | $10 | **$20** | 2x cost 💸 |
| Water | $2 | **$5** | 2.5x cost 💸 |

### Crop Sell Prices (LOWER VALUE)

### Farming Profitability Analysis

#### Carrot (Worst Case)
- **Investment:** $10 seeds + $15 water (3x) = **$25**
- **Time:** 60 seconds
- **Harvest:** 1-2 carrots × $4 = **$4-8**
- **Profit:** **LOSS of $17-21** ❌

#### Carrot (Best Case - Free Pond Water)
- **Investment:** $10 seeds + $0 water (pond) = **$10**
- **Time:** 60 seconds + pond trips
- **Harvest:** 1-2 carrots × $4 = **$4-8**
- **Profit:** **LOSS of $2-6** ❌

**Farming is now BARELY PROFITABLE and requires perfect play!**

| Resource | Before | After | Change |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Seeds | 10 | **3** | 70% less |

## 🎮 Player Experience Impact

### Before (Farm-Focused)
1. Start with 10 seeds and $50
2. Plant 6 plots in 30 seconds
3. Water quickly
4. Wait 30s, harvest 12-24 crops
5. Sell for $96-192
6. Buy more seeds, repeat
7. **Result:** Safe, profitable, boring loop

### After (Hunting-Focused)
1. Start with only 3 seeds and $30
2. Can only plant 3 crops (not enough resources!)
3. Crops take 60s+ and need lots of water
4. Harvest only gives 1-2 crops worth $4-8
5. **Farming barely breaks even**
6. **MUST hunt for real profit:**
   - Kill 2 rabbits = $30 (beats all farming)
   - Kill 1 deer = $30 (beats 5 carrot harvests)
   - Kill 1 tiger = $100 (beats 15+ carrot harvests)
7. **Result:** Risk-taking rewarded, hunting is exciting!

## 🎯 Strategic Implications

### Farming Strategy (Now Support Role)
- Use farming for **steady backup income**
- Get free water from pond (don't buy!)
- Only farm when you have spare time
- **Not enough to survive on alone**

### Hunting Strategy (Now Primary Income)
- **High risk, high reward** - best money maker
- Rabbits = safe, consistent $15
- Deer = good risk/reward at $30
- Tigers = dangerous but worth $100
- **Main income source**

### Optimal Play
1. Get free water from pond
2. Plant 3 starting seeds (free pond water)
3. While crops grow, **hunt rabbits/deer**
4. Sell meat for $15-30 each
5. Use farming as backup, not main strategy
6. Take risks with hunting for big payouts

## 📈 Expected Player Behavior

**Goal Achieved:** Players will now prefer hunting over farming because:
- ✅ Hunting is faster (instant reward vs 60-120s wait)
- ✅ Hunting is more profitable ($15-100 vs $4-10)
- ✅ Hunting has no upfront cost (farming needs seeds/water)
- ✅ Hunting is more exciting (risk/danger)
- ✅ Farming is now the "safe boring backup" option

**Risk vs Reward Balance:**
- Low risk: Farm for $4-10 per crop (slow, boring)
- Medium risk: Hunt rabbits for $15 (safe, quick)
- High risk: Hunt deer for $30 (challenging)
- Very high risk: Hunt tigers for $100 (dangerous!)
