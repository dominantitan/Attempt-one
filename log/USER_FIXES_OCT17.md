# 🔧 USER REPORTED FIXES - October 17, 2025

## 🐛 THREE CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED

### Issue 1: ✅ Mouse Cursor Lost After Hunting
**User Report:** "mouse gets lost after hunting area"  
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:**
- Mouse remained visible in overworld after exiting hunting
- Cursor should only be visible during hunting (for aiming)

**Solution:**
Added `love.mouse.setVisible(false)` in **4 exit paths**:
1. Tiger attack force-exit (line 300)
2. Tiger chase manual exit (line 715)
3. Normal safe exit (line 738)
4. State manager exit (line 753)

**Files Modified:** `states/hunting.lua`

### Issue 2: ✅ Game Not Resetting on Death
**User Report:** "everything should reset to original game state after the death like it should look like day 1 or 0"  
**Follow-up:** "is player inventory also reset if no do that also"  
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:**
- After death, inventory, crops, and blocked areas persisted
- Game didn't feel like a fresh restart
- **CRITICAL:** Inventory was being ADDED TO instead of reset (50 arrows → 60 arrows after death!)

**Solution:**
Complete game reset in `death:restart()`:
```lua
✅ Game.tigerBlockedAreas = {} // Clear all blocked zones
✅ worldAnimals = []           // Clear world animals  
✅ crops.planted = []          // Clear all crops
✅ foraging.activeCrops = []   // Clear foraged items
✅ dayCount = 0                // Reset to Day 0 (becomes Day 1 at midnight)
✅ time = 0.25                 // 6 AM morning
✅ playerEntity.load()         // Reset inventory to starting items
✅ worldSystem.load()          // Re-initialize world
✅ foragingSystem.load()       // Re-initialize foraging
✅ Mouse hidden                // Ensure cursor hidden
```

**Additional Fix in `entities/player.lua`:**
```lua
// BEFORE (BUGGY):
function player.resetStats()
    player.health = player.maxHealth
    player.stamina = player.maxStamina
    player.hunger = player.maxHunger
    // Inventory NOT cleared! ❌
}

// AFTER (FIXED):
function player.resetStats()
    player.health = player.maxHealth
    player.stamina = player.maxStamina
    player.hunger = player.maxHunger
    
    // CRITICAL FIX: Clear inventory completely
    player.inventory = {
        items = {},
        maxSlots = 20,
        money = 0
    } ✅
}
```

**Files Modified:** 
- `states/death.lua` (death reset logic)
- `entities/player.lua` (inventory reset in resetStats)

**Result:** Death now = complete fresh start with exactly 10 arrows, 3 seeds, 2 water, $30

### Issue 3: ✅ Tiger Blocking After New Day
**User Report:** "after you sleep and u wake up at another day still u can't enter the hunting area it says tiger spotted which it shouldn't have as new day started"  
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:**
- Tiger blocking persisted even after sleeping to new day
- "Tiger spotted" message appeared incorrectly

**Root Cause:**
- Day counter started at 1 after death
- When midnight hit, it became Day 2
- Tiger block recorded as Day 1
- Comparison: blockedDay (1) == currentDay (2) → FALSE (correct)
- BUT after death reset to Day 1, comparison became TRUE (bug!)

**Solution:**
Changed death reset to start at **Day 0** instead of Day 1:
```lua
daynightSystem.dayCount = 0  // Was: 1
```

**Logic Flow (FIXED):**
```
Death Reset → Day 0
Midnight → Day 1 (first day)
Tiger blocks area → stores Day 1
Sleep to midnight → Day 2
Check: blockedDay (1) != currentDay (2) → UNBLOCKED ✅
```

**Files Modified:** `states/death.lua`

**Additional Context:**
Tiger reset at midnight already implemented yesterday in `systems/daynight.lua`:
```lua
if daynight.time >= 1.0 then
    if Game and Game.tigerBlockedAreas then
        Game.tigerBlockedAreas = {}
    end
end
```

## 🧪 TESTING VERIFICATION

### Test 1: Mouse Cursor
```
1. Enter hunting area → Mouse visible ✅
2. Exit hunting (any method) → Mouse hidden ✅
3. Move around overworld → No cursor ✅
```

### Test 2: Death Reset
```
1. Play game, collect items, plant crops
2. Get killed by tiger

   - Inventory = 10 arrows, 3 seeds, $30 ✅
   - No crops planted ✅
   - Day counter = Day 0 ✅
   - No tiger blocked areas ✅
   - Mouse hidden ✅
```

### Test 3: Tiger Blocking Expiry
```
1. Enter hunting, provoke tiger
2. Area shows "BLOCKED (Tiger sighting today!)" ✅
3. Exit and sleep to next day
4. Return to same area
5. Shows "Press ENTER to hunt" (not blocked) ✅
```
