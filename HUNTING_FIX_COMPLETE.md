# Hunting System Fix - OLD vs NEW

## ✅ Problem Solved!

### The Issue:
There were **TWO hunting systems** in the code:
1. **OLD System**: `systems/hunting.lua` (89 lines) - Top-down view
2. **NEW System**: `states/hunting.lua` (799 lines) - DOOM first-person

Both were loaded, causing the OLD system to interfere with the NEW system.

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

### File: `main.lua`

**Before (BROKEN)**:
```lua
local huntingSystem = require("systems/hunting")  -- OLD system loaded ❌
-- ...
huntingSystem.load()  -- OLD system initialized ❌
```

**After (FIXED)**:
```lua
-- local huntingSystem = require("systems/hunting") -- DISABLED ✅
-- ...
-- huntingSystem.load() -- DISABLED ✅
```

### Result:
- ❌ OLD `systems/hunting.lua` - **DISABLED** (commented out)
- ✅ NEW `states/hunting.lua` - **ACTIVE** (being used)

---

## 🎯 What You'll See Now:

When you press ENTER at a hunting zone, you'll see the **NEW first-person system**:

### Visual Elements:
1. ✅ **Dark green background** (solid color)
2. ✅ **5 bushes** (darker green rectangles)
3. ✅ **Player sprite** at bottom-center
4. ✅ **Weapon** pointing at cursor
5. ✅ **Crosshair** (white cross)
6. ✅ **UI panel** (timer, ammo, kills)
7. ✅ **Animals** spawning/peeking
8. ✅ **Arrow visible** on bow
9. ✅ **Mouse aiming** controls
10. ✅ **First-person view**

### What You WON'T See:
- ❌ Top-down bird's eye view
- ❌ Circular boundary
- ❌ Player walking around
- ❌ Animals walking in circles
- ❌ "Press H to hunt" messages

## 🐛 If Still Seeing OLD System:

### Checklist:
1. ✅ Restart the game (close and reopen)
2. ✅ Verify main.lua changes saved
3. ✅ Check console for "systems/hunting" loading message
4. ✅ Make sure states/hunting.lua exists (799 lines)

### If Problems Persist:
The old system files still exist but are disabled:
- `systems/hunting.lua` - Still in folder but not loaded
- `systems/areas.lua` - hunting_area definitions exist but not used
- These can be deleted if needed, but commenting out is safer

---

## 📁 File Status:

### Active Files (Being Used):
✅ `states/hunting.lua` (799 lines) - NEW first-person system
✅ `states/gameplay.lua` - Triggers hunting state
✅ `states/gamestate.lua` - Manages state switching
✅ `systems/areas.lua` - Zone detection only (drawing disabled)

### Inactive Files (Disabled):
❌ `systems/hunting.lua` (89 lines) - Commented out in main.lua
❌ Area-based hunting draw/update functions - Bypassed
